# Formalizing Verification in Lean â€“ FU Berlin Block Course March 2025

## Announcements

* Our PR [#23172](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/23172) has been accepted ðŸŽ‰ Thank you everyone for participating!
* The course starts at 10:00 on **Friday the 21st of March**.
* The course will take place in _room 1.3.48 of the physics building_ (Arnimallee 14) on **Friday the 14th of March**.
* The afternoon session will start half an hour later than usual at 14:30 on **Thursday the 13th of March**.
* Due to a planned power outage at ZIB, the course will take place in _room 1.3.48 of the physics building_ (Arnimallee 14) on **Tuesday the 10th of March**. If the power is back for the afternoon, we will move back to the ZIB for the second part that day.

## General notes

* This is the first time this course is being held. The structure is tentative and subject to change. Constructive feedback is welcomed throughout the course and afterwards.
* The course is split into two sessions (9:30 to 12:30 and 14:00 to 17:00) per day and takes place from Monday the 10th of March to Friday the 21st of March. The usual venue will be either the big lecture hall or small seminar room at the ZIB.
* The course is open to everyone, including guest auditors (GasthÃ¶rer), not just those who need it for their ABV modules. However, priority will be given to FU students who need the course as part of their degree program.
* Participants need to bring a laptop to do the exercises and follow along during the course and work on exercises and project work.
* Completion of Analysis I and Linear Algebra I should provide a sufficient mathematical background, but participants should have a strong understanding of these subjects, as formal proof verification is very "unforgiving". No prior programming experience is required, but a certain "technical affinity and interest" is needed.
* The course will be conducted in English, but students may express themselves in German if they prefer.

## Technical difficulties

### Wrangling `lean` and `lake`

* `lake init ProjectName math` sets up a project with mathlib as a dependency in the current folder.
* `lake build` builds the project.
* If your info view shows that it is compiling a lot of files from mathlib, then (1) run `pkill -f lean` (MacOS / Linux) or `Stop-Process -Name *lean* -Force` (Windows) to kill the running Lean processes, (2) run `lake exe cache get` to download the mathlib binaries again, and finally (3) restart the Lean server by clicking on the `âˆ€` button in VS Code and choosing `Server: Restart Server`.
* In the worst case, deleting the `.lake` folder and running `lake clean` can fix many issues.

### Versioning with `git`

*To be added.*

## Resources

### Documentation and search
